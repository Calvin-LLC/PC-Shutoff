# Shutdown your pc from your android phone!

I made this because my cat was sleeping on top of me and I wanted to turn off my computer before going to sleep, with this program, now I can!

to launch the program whenever you turn on your computer: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-app-to-run-automatically-at-startup-in-windows-10-150da165-dcd9-7230-517b-cf3c295d89dd<br>
